# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render correctly when the data it's expecting from an API call is delayed or empty. The issue is that the FlatList might not handle these scenarios gracefully, resulting in an empty or unresponsive UI.

## Bug Description
The provided `bug.js` file contains code that fetches data from an API. If the API response is delayed or empty, the FlatList component does not render any items, potentially leading to a blank screen or an unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution that addresses the issue. This solution involves using a loading indicator to provide feedback to the user while waiting for the API response, and handling the case of an empty response gracefully by displaying an appropriate message.
